# Easy Exploit

Change the ssas user password and remove the user from the sudo group, to make it impossible to gain elevated access from it.

Do this as the last thing on the machine, unless you have already setup the hard exploit and can SSH directly into the root user.

Steps:
1. Log in to the machine and gain elevated access
2. Change the password of the ssas user: `passwd ssas`
   1. Set `qwerty` to be the new password
3. Remove the ssas user from the sudo group: `deluser ssas sudo`
